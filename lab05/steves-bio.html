    Hello! My name is Cara Steves, and I am a sophomore at Syracuse Universityâ€™s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. I am studying Public Relations with a minor in Information Management and Technology, and I hope to pursue a career in public policy or corporate communications. I am skilled in Microsoft and Adobe products, and have developed strong written and verbal communication skills throughout my time at The Newhouse School. On campus, I am involved in PRSSA, a student-run entertainment programming club called University Union, and Greek Life. Outside of the classroom, I love indoor cycling classes, hanging out with my friends, journaling, reading, and listening to Taylor Swift. Being from Michigan, I have a strong appreciation for nature and I love spending time outside. I have loved my time at Syracuse University so far, and I look forward to a future of learning new skills and becoming more prepared for the professional world!
