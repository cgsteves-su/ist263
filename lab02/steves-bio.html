    <h2> Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of the classroom, I love indoor cycling classes, hanging out with my friends, journaling, reading, and listening to Taylor Swift. Being from Michigan, I have a strong appreciation for nature and I love spending time outside. I have loved my time at Syracuse University so far, and I look forward to a future of learning new skills and becoming more prepared for the professional world!
