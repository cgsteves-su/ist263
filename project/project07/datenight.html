 <h1>What to Wear: Date Night Edition</h1>
 <p>In college, the opportunity to dress up doesn’t come often, but when it does, you want to be prepared to look your best, whether you’re bringing a date or a roommate to your date party. Here are some tips to make your date night look as memorable and iconic as possible.</p>
 <h2>The Dress</h2>
 <p>Finding the perfect dress for date night can be a challenge, especially when on a budget. No one wants to have to purchase a new dress for every upcoming function. If you don’t want to splurge on something new, my trick is to borrow something! Borrowed dresses, heels, or even small accessories can be the missing piece to creating an amazing date night outfit.</p>
 <p>However, if you are in the market to splurge, Tigermist, Revolve, and PepperMayo have incredible, trendy, and decently priced finds that you will be sure to wear again and again. Opting for a pop of color can be showstopping, but a little-black-dress never fails to create a classic look. No matter the color, picking a flattering and comfortable dress style is key to dressing for success. A unique neckline, ruched fabric, or an open back are some of my personal favorite styles. 
    When choosing a dress, always go for the bolder option. Playing it safe is no option for date night.</p>
<p>If a dress is not your vibe, or you are looking to switch it up, opt for a matching set! A stunning, sheer, long sleeve top with matching sparkly pants could not only keep you warm but could also create a specialized look. A skirt and top set can also replicate a more casual look if you aren’t looking to fully commit to a dress.</p>

<h2>Accessories</h2>
<p>Though it is popular to wear sneakers or boots with a beautiful dress at date parties, heels will always elevate a look to the next level and leave you feeling unstoppable. Though painful at times, when else do you get a chance to wear heels in Syracuse, New York? I am someone who usually opts for comfort, even when I choose heels. A kitten heel or little stiletto can be more suitable than a chunky platform heel. However, if you have a high pain tolerance and strong sense of balance, there is no heel too outlandish for a night out. If high heels aren’t your thing at all, a platform or cowboy boot are surefire ways to garner compliments and switch up the vibe of a classic date night outfit.</p>
<p>Adding a hairpiece, whether it be a dainty bow or ribbon, a small flower, or even a studded headband can also add dimension to an outfit and help create a cohesive look depending on dress and shoe choice. Personally, I think dainty hair clips are the simplest accessory to add a personal touch to an outfit, as well as draw more attention to whatever hairstyle you choose. And though for younger women in college purses may seem obsolete, a small bag may just be the piece that will tie together a look. A small, sparkly shoulder bag can easily be thrifted and will serve as a practical style choice when you need gum, lip gloss, or cash.</p>

<p>Date night is one of the few nights where personal style can truly be expressed while dressing up. A special outfit is the foundation to creating a positive, confident, and fun aura for the night. Whether you choose to keep it simple, or commit to a full-glam look, feeling comfortable and beautiful in your choice will surely make for a memorable night.</p>
