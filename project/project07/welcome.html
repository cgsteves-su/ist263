 <h1>Welcome to Cara's Closet!</h1>

   <div><p>Hi everyone, welcome to my closet! My whole life, I have found joy from picking out unique and special clothes for various occasions. 
   As a college student, it can be hard to create cute and unique outfits on a budget and with little time. Despite this, I still believe that <strong>clothing is one of the best ways to show the world who you are</strong>. Believe it or not, there are so many simple ways to add personalized touches to outfits for every occasion. 
   This page will help you discover those tricks!</p></div>

   <div><p>On this page, you will find outfit inspiration for 3 different events:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Going to class</li>
         <li>Game day</li>
         <li>Date night</li>
      </ol>
   </div>
<p>I am going to give my spin on outfit ideas for these scenarios, gaining inspiration from what I see Syracuse students wearing and connecting them to popular social media trends. After reading, you will be prepared to <strong>conquer campus by showing off your personality and looking amazing doing it.</strong></p></div>
