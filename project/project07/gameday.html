 <h2>How to Slay Game Day</h2>
 <p>One of the most exciting and spirited aspects for many Syracuse students are game days. 
    Nothing screams SU like the student section decked out in a sea of orange and blue, with the scent of Dome chicken tenders wafting through the air, and the crowd screaming over the sound of mediocre sports being played. 
    Students can showcase their love for the Syracuse Orange in the unique and interesting game day outfits they put together; perfect for football season, basketball season, and everything in between.</p></div>

    <h3>Syracuse Staples</h3>
 <p>Though many believe that orange and blue are the most difficult colors to make look fabulous, these bright colors can make for a fun and abstract look. For game days, investing in a few statement pieces will be key, especially since many donâ€™t have a plethora of orange items hidden in the backs of their closets. On warmer days, a denim skirt with a fun, orange, top creates a simple yet playful look. However, on the chillier game days, look to thrift a Syracuse bomber or jean jacket to keep you warm on your trek to the Dome. 
        Parachute pants are also coming back into style and can be easily thrifted for an 80s inspired gameday look. 
        Paired with a baby-tee or neutral colored turtleneck, you will be kept warm while staying on theme.</p></div>

        <h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>Fun accessories are essential for game days, with unique hairstyles like braids and high ponytails being seen frequently. 
    Rain or shine, sunglasses will forever make for the perfect accessory to add an interesting element to any outfit. Not only do they look great in pictures, but they are a practical accessory on bright and sunny Syracuse game days. My favorite pair of sunglasses are from the Dollar Store. 
    On the same sun protecting note; a baseball, trucker, or bucket hat can help protect from sun rays while spicing up any basic outfit.</p></div>

    <h3>Overall, You Need Overalls.</h3>
<p>Lastly, one of my personal gameday favorites are overalls. Also easily thriftable, overalls are an adorable spin on a Syracuse game day outfit. An orange, Syracuse themed t-shirt can easily be thrown under a pair of long or short overalls. 
    Tying a bow to the straps adds a fun pop of color and hint of uniqueness that could create a memorable game day look.</p>
<p>Between accessorizing, thrifting special Syracuse gear, and playing with color, the possibilities to create a cool gameday look are endless. 
    Overall, there are many fun and special ways to create a personalized gameday look that will not only make for amazing photos, but unforgettable memories.</p></div>
